Thanks very much for using the Violin Plot! This visual is released under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) and is free and open source. I develop this visual in my free time, so I'll try and provide support where I can.

If you still need assistance after reading the documentation and you've checked the Known Issues for your version, you can see if anything similar has been raised in the [issues list](https://github.com/dm-p/powerbi-visuals-violin-plot/issues).

If your issue is not present, [please create a new one](https://github.com/dm-p/powerbi-visuals-violin-plot/issues/new/choose). There are templates for Bug Reports and Enhancement Requests - ideally, if you can provide the majority of information asked for, it is much easier for me to understand your perspective as a user of the visual and help you faster :)
